# petal Alpha 0.0 :tulip:
A mini library of ia for C++ (thats the plan that i think)


- tested in linux |:x:|
- Compiled and the code works |:x:|
- tested in windows 10 |:x:|
- finished |:x:|
- It work in other machines? |:x:|

An simple ia same like machine learning with templates

Some of the functions are ``` petal_reg(some object)   ``` or  ```  petal_return();  ```  

syntax example:  

 ```c++ 
 #include "petal_/petal.h"
 
 int main() {
petal<int , 10> ia;

ia.petal_return();
ia.petal_reg(123);
ia.petal_algorithm();
}
```
**Note:** this version its in alpha can be big changed (include the sintax)

**Another Note:** Cloning this repository can have errors (report it in issues if you have it!)
